Assignment 2 - Laboratory


Part 1:

For this lab:
   lnxsrv06 - Client
   lnxsrv07 - Server

ssh codyd@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu
   // (Entered my password when prompted)

ssh-keygen
   // (When asked for password, I pressed 'Enter' for no password)

ssh-copy-id codyd@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
   // (Entered my SEASnet password when prompted)

ssh codyd@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
   // (Successfully logged into lnxsrv07 with no password. Part 1 is complete.)


Part 2:

*Logged out completely, installed XQuartz, and restarted

xeyes
   // (Tried on local machine to make sure it worked first)

ssh -X codyd@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu
   // (Entered my SEASnet password when prompted)

xeyes
   // (Gave output of "Error: Can't open display:")

logout

ssh -X codyd@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu
   // (Entered my SEASnet password when prompted)

xeyes
   // (The graphical window properly appeared on my window. Part 2 is complete.)


Part 3:

*Starting off inside lnxsrv06

cd .ssh

emacs config
   // (create config file for ssh)

I inserted the following into the config file:

Host srv7
  HostName lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
  User codyd

Host srv8
  HostName lnxsrv08.seas.ucla.edu
  User codyd
  ProxyJump srv7, srv8

Host srv9
  HostName lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
  User codyd
  ProxyJump srv8, srv9

// I created three Hosts: srv7, srv8, and srv9. The appropriate HostName and User
// was provided for each one (in reference to my own account). It's linked together
// so that in order so that, in order to access srvX, all servers below X must first
// be accessed. Thus, to if I did ssh srv9, the machine would access srv7 first, 
// jump to srv8, then from srv8, jump to srv9. This was tested using the following
// commands inside lnxsrv06:

ssh srv7
logout
ssh srv8
logout
ssh srv9
logout

// After each logout session, I was properly logged back into lnxsrv06. Part 3 is complete.
