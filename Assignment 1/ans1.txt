Assignment 1 -- Laboratory Scavenger Hunt Answers

1.
Command: 
   man man

Answer: 
   man -k [KEYWORD]

Approach: 
   I used man man and searched through the potential arguments. -k is described as "Search[ing] the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display[ing] any matches"


2.
Commands: 
   man -k path
   which mv
   which sh

Answers:
   mv is located at /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
   sh is located at /usr/bin/sh

Approach: 
   I originally used man -k location, but none of commands seemed relevant to the problem. Then I used man -k path and found the which command, which fits perfectly for what's asked.


3.
Commands: 
   man find
   find /usr/bin -executable -name ?r

Answers: The following are two-letter commands found in bin that end in 'r' + their functions.
   tr: Translates, squeezes, and/or deletes characters
   ar: Creates, modifies, and extracts from archives
   pr: Converts text files for printing

Approach:
    I used man find (given as a hint) to get more information on the find command. I then used it to narrow my search down properly to get the three commands above. I used man to find their functions.


4.
Commands:
   man -k path
   man realpath
   which emacs
   realpath /usr/local/cs/bin/emacs

Answer:
   /usr/local/cs/emacs-27.1/bin/emacs-27.1

Approach:
   I originally used man -k path to try to see if there was a way to jump to the emacs path directly. Instead, I found the 'realpath' command and used man realpath to read more about it. It seemed to correctly answer the question and so I used which emacs to get the appropriate link for realpath.

REAL ANSWER: /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
/etc/alternatives/emacs is also a symbolic link to /usr/bin/emacs-24.3


5.
Commands:
   gcc -v
   /usr/bin/gcc -v

Answer:
   The plain gcc is version 10.2.0
   The /usr/bin/gcc is version 4.8.5

Approach:
   I used the hints given. gcc -v was to check the plain gcc and then I just copied the link provided by the instructions and checked the version.

Local gcc (4.8.5) is a more recent version.


6.
Command:
   man chmod

Answer:
   chmod u+sx: The u stands for the current user. The + means we are granting permissions based on the two letters that follow. The s sets the user's ID to that of the owner of the document upon execution. The x grants the user permission to execute the program. 
   chmod o-w: The o stands for 'others' (not the user and not in a group). The - means we are removing permission based on the letter that follows. The w refers to write permission and thus, this command will remove the write permission from 'others' 

Approach:
   I used the hints and man chmod to help answer this question.


7.
Commands:
   man find
   find /usr/local/cs/ -type d -mtime -27

Answer:
   # of directories modified in the last 28 days: 580 directories
   The first 5 of these 580:
	/usr/local/cs/
	/usr/local/cs/src/bash
	/usr/local/cs/src/bash/RCS
	/usr/local/cs/src/grep
	/usr/local/cs/src/grep/RCS

Approach:
   I followed the hints given and used man find to read up on the extra tags/parameters. I used -type to make sure only directories were targeted and read up on the rounding information in -atime. This told me that I should use 27 instead of 28 as it appears to add an additional '1' due to the rounding logic.


8.
Commands:
   man find
   which find
   find /usr/bin/ -type l

Answer:
   There are 280 symbolic links in /usr/bin/ 

   They are listed below: 
    /usr/bin/pmiostat

Approach:
   I followed the hints and read more about find using man find. I realized I could use -type l to look at only the symbolic links and then used which find to find the directory of find.


9.
Commands:
   man ls
   ls /usr/lib64/ -lt .* REAL ANSWER: ls /usr/lib64 -lta

Answer:
   librom1394.so.0.3.0

Approach:
   I followed the hints and used man ls to read more on the ls command. I found -lt which organizes the files by modification date with the oldest at the bottom. .* Is used to look for files that start with . with any number/combination of characters after.


10.
Commands:
   man locale

Answer:
   As per the locale manual, locale 'displays the current locale setting for each locale category based on the settings of the environment variables that control the locale'.
   BASICALLY: The environment variables.

Approach:
  I simply followed the hints and read the manual.


11.
Emacs Commands:
   C-h a
   d o w n c a s e  Enter

Answer:
   downcase-dwim
   downcase-region
   downcase-word

Approach:
   I followed the reference card given by the hints and found the appropriate command.

12.
Emacs Commands:
   C-h
   ?
   b
   C-x o
   Enter

Answers:
   C-M-r (isearch-backward-regexp): Does an incremental search backward for regular expressions.
   C-M-s (isearch-forward-regexp): Does an incremental search forward for regular expressions.
   C-M-t (transpose-sexps): Similar to C-T, but applies to sexps. C-T interchanges characters around a point, moving forward one character.
   C-M-u (backward-up-list): Moves backwards out of one level of parentheses.
   C-M-v (scroll-other-window): Scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.

Approach:
   I used C-h to see if there was any generic help window. I pressed ? after it prompted me and then pressed b to find any keybindings. I used C-x o to move to the new window and scrolled down to the commands. Enter was used to follow the hyper links.


13.
Emacs Commands:
   C-h
   ?
   b
   C-x o
   Enter

Answer:
   C-g is known as 'keyboard-quit'. It signals a 'quit' condition. During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At top-level, as an editor command, it merely beeps.


14.
Emacs Commands:
   C-h a
   y a n k Enter

Answer:
   The yank command reinserts, or 'pastes', the last stretch of killed text. Yank can be easily invoked by pressing C-y.

Approach:
   I used C-h a to find the yank command. I simply scrolled down and read the information about the command.


15.
Shell Command:
   ls /usr/bin -l

Emacs Commands:
   C-h a
   d i r e d  Enter
   C-x d / u s r / b i n  Enter

Answer:
   Using ls /usr/bin -l in the shell showed all the files inside the /usr/bin directory. However, when using C-x d /usr/bin inside Emacs, it showed all the files as well as the current and parent directories, denoted as '.' and '..' respectively.
