Assignment 4 -- Lab: Installing a small change to a big package

1. 
CMDS: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
      wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
      wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

=> Used wget to pull the coreutils 8.29 source code, the signature
   and the GNU-Keyring.

CMD:  gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig 

OUTPUT:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

=> The WARNING provided by gpg is because I used a signature downloaded from
online as a verification. This key was not marked as trusted and thus we can't
tell if this signature belongs to the actual owner.


2.
CMD: tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

=> Unzips the coreutils-8.29 tar. -x is used to extract to the files from
archive, -J is used to filter for .xz, -v represents verbose and -f allows
me to specify the filename (pulled directly from Hints slides).

CMDS: cd coreutils-8.29
      emacs INSTALL

=> Entered the extracted directory and read the INSTALL file to find out how to
properly install coreutils-8.29. 

CMD:  cd ..
      mkdir cloneCoreUtils8.29
      cd coreutils-8.29
      ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/codyd/cs35L/assignment4/cloneCoreUtils8.29

=> I found out how to config coreutils and set an absolute path (confirmed by the
Hints slide). I made a directory to store the broken coreutils-8.29 in and ran the
configure code to properly configure the package before I make it.

CMD: make
     make install

=> The 'make' command compiles the package. The 'make install' command properly
installs the package at the location specified by configure in the previous
command. coreutils8.29 is successfully installed and I did not run into any
errors.


3.
CMDS: cd ..
      cd cloneCoreUtils8.29
      ./bin/ls -aA

OUTPUT: . .. bin libexec share

=> Running the 'ls -aA' command still results in both '.' and '..' being
displayed, despite the presence of 'A'. Thus, the bug has been reproduced and is
present in this version.


4.
CMDS: cd ..
      cd coreutils-8.29
      wget "https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?filename=0001-ls-A-now-
            overrides-a.patch;msg=10;att=1;bug=30963"
      mv bugreport.cgi\?filename\=0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch\;msg\=10\;att\
         =1\;bug\=30963 patch.diff
      emacs patch.diff (to check)

=> Entered the coreutils-8.29 folder and pulled the patch from the thread. I then
renamed it to 'patch.diff' 

CMD: patch -p1 < patch.diff

=> This applies the patch to the coreutils-8.29 package. The -p1 is used since
the patch file is within the coreutils-8.29 folder and therefore, the first
slash must be removed since patch is in a directory with 'src'.


5.
CMD: make

=> An error is given that says 'automake-1.15 is missing on your system.'
Error 127.

CMD: autoreconf -fi
     make

=> The first command was pulled from the Hints slide. It will properly configure
the package, allowing make to run correctly.

OUTPUT (COMMANDS):

make[1]: Leaving directory '/w/home.07/cs/ugrad/codyd/cs35L/assignment4/coreutils
-8.29'


=> These are the commands run by make. This is where make enters the files altered
by the 'patch.diff' file and makes any changes that were described in it.


6. 
CMD: ./src/ls -aA

=> No '.' or '..' are present when running this command. The patch was successfully
applied.

CMDS: cd ..
      cd cloneCoreUtils8.29
      ./bin/ls -aA

=> '.' and '..' still make an appearance here, meaning the bug is still present in
the old unpatched version if coreutils-8.29
